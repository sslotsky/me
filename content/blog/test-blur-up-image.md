# This is a simple test

When you open this blog post entry you'll see that the image will blur up. As technically in the viewport.

The reason for you not seeing it in the [first post](/blog/your-first-blog-post-with-gatsby-and-netlify-cms) is due to the fact that when you reach the pinochio area the effect has already kicked in and makes you think that the blur up never happened.
